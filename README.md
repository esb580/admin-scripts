# Admin Scripts
A collection of scripts I am adding to as I learn new technology. 

## Warning:
There are some scripts that could be damaging to your system if you run them without understanding what they do.  For instance, I have some bash scripts that execute functions stoping and removing all docker containers and images from the OS.  These I use for cleaning up my development system, and should not be executed unless you know how it works and are OK with possible unintended consequences.
